# Anomaly-Detection-in-Online-Transactions-Using-Machine-Learning-for-Fraud-Prevention
In this project, We developed a fraud detection model to predict online payment fraud using Blossom Bank PLC as a case study. Blossom Bank is a multinational financial services group based in London, UK, offering various banking, pension, asset management, and payment services. The goal of building this machine learning model is to help Blossom Bank keep pace with rapidly evolving technological threats and prevent financial losses (profit) due to fraud. Additionally, the model aims to accurately detect and identify anomalies in online transactions that may not be caught by traditional rule-based methods.

The steps involved in developing this model include:1. Loading necessary Python libraries.2. Loading the dataset containing transactional data.3. Conducting exploratory data analysis to understand the data better and uncover any patterns or insights.4. Performing data transformation, including using resampling techniques to address class imbalance issues commonly encountered in fraud detection tasks.5. Engaging in feature engineering to extract relevant features from the data that can improve the performance of the model.6. Training the machine learning model using the prepared dataset.7. Evaluating the performance of the trained model to assess its effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.

Throughout the project, We encountered several challenges, particularly during the coding phase. These challenges were often related to issues such as improper documentation, syntax errors, and difficulties with feature engineering techniques like one-hot encoding. Addressing these challenges required extensive research and careful attention to detail. For example, We resolved the encoding issue by using the 'pd.get_dummies()' function and making specific adjustments to the methods used in the feature engineering process.

By overcoming these challenges and successfully developing the fraud detection model, Blossom Bank aims to improve its quality assurance processes, retain existing customers, attract new ones, and ultimately increase its credit and profit base. Additionally, the insights gained from the model can inform policy and decision-making processes within the organization, contributing to overall risk management and business strategy.
